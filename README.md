A Library Provides Extensible Effects in Typed Racket.

The typed version has several limitations due to the design of Typed Racket.

We did't use any Any and unsafe operations in the code.
## Progress
APIs of typed version may not change in future versions.

Roadmaps:

- Need some auxiliary macros (work in progress).

- Need untyped version.

- Need documents.


## Usage
See tests.
