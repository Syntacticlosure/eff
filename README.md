# eff
A Library Provides Extensible Effects in Typed Racket.

## Progress
This project is still in experimental and not ready for production use.

Roadmaps:

- Need polymorphic effects (finished), polymorphic effect handlers (finsihed),
  and polymorphic operations.

- Need some auxiliary macros (in progress).

- Need untyped version.

- Need documents.


## Usage
See tests.
